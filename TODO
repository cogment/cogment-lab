Idea:
- Support native gymnasium VectorEnv when we finish the API
- Support launching the same environment in several processes as cogment-based vectorization



TODO:
- Improve robustness of the UI? (reconnecting, etc.)
- Better UI builder (define buttons, sliders, etc.)
- More QoL functions (are any missing?)
- Clean up logging (probably need to define a logger somewhere in top level of the library? maybe in each file?)
- Enable running services in the main process (async; actors work, do the same for envs and web_ui)
- Maybe rename web_ui to human?
- Add more conversions (observer, teacher for PettingZoo)
- Add support for vectorized envs, vectorized actors
- Add support for parallel envs
- Do batched evaluation with vectorized envs, homogeneous pettingzoo parallel envs
- Connect4 integration
- Instead of a fancy BaseEnv/BaseActor, use Gymnasium EZPickle (or reimplement, it's super simple)
