    "## Some background\n",
    "\n",
    "Cogment is based on a microservice architecture. This means that each environment and agent runs as a separate service (typically, but not strictly necessarily, in a separate process). These services communicate with each other via gRPC, through the intermediate layer of the Cogment Orchestrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic unit of interaction in Cogment (and by extension, in Cogment Lab) is a *trial*, which contains a single RL episode -- from reset to termination, involving a single environment and one or more agents. While this is a bit restrictive, the upside is that the agents aren't restricted to being RL agents, but can in fact be real humans. This is the main use-case for Cogment Lab: to run RL experiments with human participants. "
